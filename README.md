 *DESCRIPTION* : A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like model of decisions. Each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a final prediction (a class label or value).
 
A Decision Tree involves:                                                                                                                                                                                       

Input Data: Features and labels.

Splitting: Dividing data based on feature values using metrics like Gini or Entropy.

Tree Structure: Nodes for decisions, branches for outcomes, leaves for predictions.

Recursive Growth: Repeats splitting until a stopping rule is met.

Prediction: Uses the path from root to leaf based on input features.

(Optional) Pruning: Removes unnecessary branches to reduce overfitting.

Application : Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and risk prediction

Finance: Loan approval, credit scoring, fraud detection

Retail: Customer segmentation, churn prediction

Education: Student performance and dropout prediction

Manufacturing: Quality control, predictive maintenance

Cybersecurity: Spam detection, intrusion detection

Agriculture: Crop yield and disease prediction
